# Bert_Google_Model
I used RFP-1.txt to bulit Bert model in that i have chosen bert-base-uncased.
Installed tensorflow and pytorch_pretrained_bert. Imported torch,BertTokenizer, BertModel, BertForMaskedLM, BertForSequenceClassification. Test the tokenizer.Convert text to csv file and convert to Dataframe. 
wget is used to link with the Bert model which is present in the github.
From sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split to split train and test text.Build the model,Prepare optimizer, train the model,evaluating the model,Predicting using the built model and submission of accuracy and loss.
when model is running i am getting:-
ERROR:root:Internal Python error in the inspect module.
Which is the CPU progrmmed error.
